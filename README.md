## Usage

### Comments

Source files with a comment file will be automatically rendered through Ghomments. Ghomments will insert a header at the top of the file with the location of the comments.

If the comments for a file are not rendered automatically you can manually render the comments by running the `Ghomments Render` from the command palette.

The `open comment on GH` will take you directly to the comment on the GitHub pull request.

To turn off the rendered comments on a file use the key combo: `CTRL + CMD + SHIFT + C`

### Toggling between Diff and Source File

You can use the key combo: `CMD + SHIFT + B` to toggle between a diff file and its source file

For example to move between `xyz.scala` <-> `xyz.scala.diff`
