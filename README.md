## Usage

After checking our a pull request with purs, if you want to overlay the comments for a given file, run `Ghomments Render` from the command palette.

For example, if you checked out file XYZ.rs and there's an XYZ.rs.comment file in the same directory, open up the XYZ.rs file and run `Ghomments Render`.

Ghomments will insert a header at the top of the file with the location of the comments.
